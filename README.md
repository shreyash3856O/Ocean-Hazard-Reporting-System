# Crowdsourced-Ocean-Hazard-Reporting-System

🌊 **Overview**
MyCoast India is a real-time ocean hazard monitoring and coastal safety platform designed to help beachgoers, fishermen, coastal communities, and authorities stay informed about dangerous sea conditions. The platform crowdsources hazard reports, visualizes risk zones, and supports faster, more coordinated responses along the coastline.

🚨 **Problem**
India’s coastlines frequently face rip currents, high waves, sudden underwater depressions, pollution patches, and jellyfish swarms. There is no unified system that gathers community reports, visualizes danger zones, and helps the public make informed decisions before entering the water.

✅ **Solution**
A crowdsourced and authority-supported platform that collects hazard reports, displays them on a live coastal map, provides safety indicators, and offers features like family reunification and resource tracking for lifeguards.
